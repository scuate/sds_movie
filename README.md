### A spoken dialogue system for movie information retrieved from Rotten Tomatoes API
--built in VoiceXML and PHP
##### This project contains three files: 
1. MoviePhone.xml (contains universals and global variables) 
2. dynamic_lst.php (holds a form asking for a movie name)
3. dynamic_info.php (holds a form which requests the choice of available options on the detailed movie information and gives the answer)

##### Resources used:
1. https://evolution.voxeo.com/  Evolution: Voxeoâ€™s Global Developer and Support Portal
2. http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/  Rotten Tomatoes API (non-commercial use will expire in 6 months)

##### Disclaimer:
This is a collaborative work of me and Joe Mulvey. I was responsible for the two dynamic forms (i.e. dynamic_lst.php, dynamic_info.php)
